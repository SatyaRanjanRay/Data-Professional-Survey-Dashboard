# Data-Professional-Survey-Dashboard
Dashboard on Data Professional Survey 🤵🏻📝

In this Project I have done visualisation on a Data Professional Survey Dataset which involves informations on Survey Respondents such as their Job role, Salary, Industry they work in, Career transition info, Favourite Programming language, Preferable Job role, Satisfactory rating on different aspects like Salary, Work/Life balance,Coworkers etc. 

By importing the Survey dataset, I cleaned and loaded the data using Power Query then I visualized the data using various visual representations such as Treemap,Stacked bar and column chart, Clustered column chart, gauge charts etc to gain insights over the survey report.

# Some Key insights from the dashboard:
- The majority of survey respondents in the data field are from the United States, and the average age of respondents is approximately 30 years old.
- Respondents from the USA rated the salary rating comparatively higher than others, which is likely due to the fact that the average salary in the data field is       higher in USA than in other countries.
- Data scientists earn higher salaries compared to others. 
- Python is the most preferred programming language among respondents in the data analytics field.
- Approximately 59% of survey respondents have transitioned to a career in the data field.
- Survey respondents from India reported lower levels of satisfaction with work-life balance, salary, and coworkers compared to other countries.
